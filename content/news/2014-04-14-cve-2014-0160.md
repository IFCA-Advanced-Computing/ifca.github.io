Summary: Important information about CVE-2014-0160 at IFCA.

AS you may have heard, a [grave vulnerability in OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt)
was disclosed Monday last week: [CVE-2014-0160](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160)
(also known as Heartbleed).

OpenSSL is a cryptographic software behind a huge number of the private
communications across the internet (i.e. the `s` of the `https` but not
only). Namely, it is responsible for verifying the identity of servers
and clients (they are who they say they are) and for keeping
communications private.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to reveal up to 64kB of memory
to a connected client or server if they were using a vulnerable OpenSSL
version. The information that the attacker can get may contain (among
other things):

 - Usernames, passwords and sessions for the logged users.
 - Private keys from the servers.

Currently we have no evidence that the attack has been made against our
affected servers, although the vulnerability has been undetected for two
years. However, we have taken the following actions so as to mitigate
any possible effects:

 - We have upgraded and patched all of our servers to a non-vulnerable
   version of OpenSSL.
 - We have revoked all affected server's certificates.
 - We have deployed the new certificates last Friday.

## What can you do?

If you were using any version between `1.0.1` and `1.0.1f` probably you need
to upgrade your OpenSSL version to a non vulnerable one. You should
check your GNU/Linux distribution security advisories for more details
on how to proceed.

Although we are not going to force the reset of the user's password, it
is recommended that you change your password as soon as possible. Since
this is a widespread vulnerability, the IFCA Computing team recommends
that you change your password in any service that might have been
affected and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.
