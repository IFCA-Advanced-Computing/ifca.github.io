On October the 29th (next Tuesday) we will upgrade our [OpenStack](http://cloud.ifca.es)
cloud infrastrucutre from Grizzly to the latest [Havana](http://www.openstack.org/software/havana/)
release.

Some of the Grid service and worker nodes are executed on top of this infrastructure, therefore
some glitches in their availability are expected during the morning.

You can check the [downtime on the GOCDB](https://goc.egi.eu/portal/index.php?Page_Type=Downtime&id=12066).
