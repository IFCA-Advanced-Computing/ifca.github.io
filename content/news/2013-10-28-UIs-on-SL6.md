Summary: Scientific Linux 6-based user interfaces (UIs) available at IFCA Cluster.

All the users with access to IFCA cluster can now make use of Scientific Linux 6-based
user interfaces. To access them just connect via SSH protocol to `griduisl6.ifca.es` 
and you will be redirected to any of the available servers.

The most noticeable fact in the new SL6 pool is that they are running over the OpenStack
cloud infrastructure hosted at IFCA. As a result `griduiXX` hostnames will no longer appear, 
instead `cloudprv` identifiers will be used from now on. The performance will not be neither
hit nor enhanced, since the already existing ones (SL5) are also virtualized.

Our intention is to progresivelly move to a fully SL6-based UI stack, so we encourage users
to try them and report any incidence that can occur. The deadline to drop the old SL5 servers
is by the end of the year 2013, however this date can be postponed if needed. We will send 
a reminder when this deadline approaches.

Enjoy!
